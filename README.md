# Hello

I'm Jorge and I'm a software developer professionally, but really I'm a problem solver at heart. Right now I have expertise in the trendy tech, like React and TypeScript, but I've also worked in Angular, Java Spring Boot, .NET, and even older tech like jQuery and Razor. Whatever the tech, the problem solving is what I really care about. I'd love to get my hands dirty in some Rust, Go, C and/or C++, Odin, Lua (with static types only, sorry nerds), OCaml, and big daddy Haskell.

My GitHub profile is a little eclectic, messy, confusing, befuddling, and overall unkempt. This is honestly because I'm a workaholic who spends the majority of his time working on private stuff, either work repos or repos that I'm not eager to share. My public work is neither the best I have to offer, nor the most interesting, and there are lots of old repos I should probably delete some day.

### I've worked on

Front end web apps, back end web apps, and mobile native apps. I also work on video games on and off in my spare time, and have worked in Unity, Godot, en even just React Native.

### I would like to work on

Architectural diagrams and README files. I have a background in humanities, so I'd love nothing more than to think about high level architecture, map it out, help a team, and/or implement it myself. I enjoy most when I can make myself available to others and make their work a little easier, so my real passion is in increasing DX and improving communication within and across teams.

### In my spare time

I enjoy some weightlifting, reading novels and poetry, cooking, playing video games with friends, and making my own video games. I've started about a dozen games and life has always gotten in the way. Right now I'm building a game in React Native to try to get the ball rolling, and then maybe I'll port it over to Godot if performance becomes a real issue. Oh and I've deadlifted 215kg before with clean form.

### You can find me on
